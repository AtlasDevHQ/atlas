 * and do NOT use this type.
 *
 * Authorization rides on exactly ONE of two mutually-exclusive credential
 * classes — never both:
 *  - the `atlas login` device-flow SESSION bearer (interactive / ambient reuse),
 *    sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; OR
 *  - a workspace-scoped API key for UNATTENDED CI (#4046), sent as
 *    `x-api-key: <key>` (the Better Auth `apiKey()` plugin's header).
 *
 * Modelled as an XOR (a discriminated union), NOT two independent optionals, so
 * "exactly one credential" is a compile-time invariant the clients can't violate
 * — there is no representable `{ token, apiKey }` (both) or `{}` (neither) state.
 * The server resolves whichever header it sees to the bound workspace and runs
 * the full gate chain; the CLI never re-derives any of that and never sends an
 * org/workspace field.
