/**
 * Wire format for `executeSQL` tool results.
 *
 * Single-environment executions emit a 1-element `envContributions` array
 * (just the one connection that ran). Cross-environment fanouts (PRD #2515,
 * `scope: "all"` or picker mode `all`) emit one entry per member of the
 * active connection group, so SDK consumers can render side-by-side panes
 * keyed by `connectionId`.
 *
 * The runtime shape produced by `mergeMemberResults` in
 * `@atlas/api/lib/multi-env-merger` mirrors {@link ConnectionContribution}
 * exactly. The merger's interface IS the wire shape — both sides converged
 * during slice 4 (#2519).
 *
 * @see PRD #2515 — agent-routed cross-environment querying
 * @see issue #2519 — slice 4 acceptance criteria

 * execution; the overall tool-call `executionMs` is the max across
