/**
 * Migration cleanup for legacy cross-subdomain auth cookies (#4086).
 *
 * Before ADR-0024 §5, managed-mode Better Auth was configured with
 * `advanced.crossSubDomainCookies`, so the session cookies were minted with a
 * parent-domain attribute (`Domain=useatlas.dev`, stored by the browser as
 * `.useatlas.dev` and sent to every subdomain). ADR-0024 §5 switched to
 * HOST-ONLY cookies (no `Domain`, scoped to the issuing region host) but never
 * CLEARED the parent-domain cookies already sitting in users' browsers.
 *
 * The result, for anyone who logged in before the switch: a request to
 * `api.useatlas.dev` carries TWO `__Secure-<prefix>.session_token` cookies —
 * the stale parent-domain one AND the new host-only one. Better Auth reads the
 * stale shadow first → it points at a dead session → 401. The session survives
 * for exactly one `session.cookieCache.maxAge` window (Atlas default
 * `SESSION_COOKIE_CACHE_DEFAULT_SEC` = 30s, operator-tunable — NOT Better Auth's
 * 300s framework default) because the *live* `session_data` cache cookie is
 * host-only and points at the real session; any legacy parent-domain
 * `session_data` twin is short-lived and expired long before this window, so
 * nothing keeps the dead shadow alive. Once the live cache lapses, Better Auth
 * falls back to the `session_token` cookie, reads the stale parent-domain shadow
 * first → dead session → every authenticated call (`/api/v1/*`, `get-session`)
 * 401s and the app bounces to `/login`. The parent-domain cookie also leaks to
 * every region edge (`api-eu`/`api-apac`), which independently violates
 * ADR-0024 §5.
 *
 * This module detects the shadow — the session-token cookie name present more
 * than once in the request `Cookie` header — and produces `Set-Cookie`
 * deletions scoped to each parent domain of the request host, so the browser
 * evicts the legacy cookie on its next request to ANY endpoint. It is
 * self-limiting: a clean browser (or one already migrated) has the name at most
 * once, so no deletions are emitted. The deletion targets the parent-domain
 * cookie only (it carries `Domain=`); the host-only cookie Better Auth sets in
 * the same response has no `Domain` and is a distinct cookie, so it is never
 * touched.
 *
 * Detection is name-only — the `Cookie` header carries no `Domain`, so a browser
 * holding ONLY the stale parent-domain cookie (count = 1) is indistinguishable
 * from a clean host-only browser and is not cleaned until a successful re-login
 * mints the host-only twin (flipping the count to 2). That is an accepted
 * limitation: a single cookie can't be proven stale from the request alone.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free so it can be unit-tested without standing up Hono or
 * Better Auth; the API wires it as a `/api/*` response middleware (see
 * `legacy-cookie-cleanup-middleware.ts`).
 */

/**
 * Session cookie suffixes a deletion targets. `session_token` is the actual
 * shadow that breaks auth; `session_data` is cleared defensively in case the
 * legacy `crossSubDomainCookies` config also minted a parent-domain cache twin —
 * in practice it has long since expired (see the module docblock), so that
 * deletion is usually a harmless no-op rather than a load-bearing one.
