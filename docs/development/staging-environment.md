# Staging environment — operator runbook

Staging is the **soak environment** that sits between `main` and a tag-gated prod
deploy. Every merge to `main` deploys to staging automatically; prod only moves
when a release tag is cut (see [release-process.md](./release-process.md) and
[ADR-0008](../adr/0008-versioning-and-release-tags.md)). Staging is where we
dogfood a change against production-shaped infrastructure before it can reach
customers.

This document is the **end-to-end operator runbook**: it should be followable by
someone who has never seen the staging design. It assumes you have admin access
to the Railway project, the DNS zone for `useatlas.dev`, and the provider
consoles (Slack, Linear, GitHub, Google, Twenty, Stripe, Resend). The design
rationale lives in the [staging PRD](../prd/staging-environment.md) ([#2893](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2893));
this runbook is the **how**, the PRD is the **why**.

> **Status (slice 11 of 22 — [milestone #57](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/milestone/57)).**
> **All code-side slices are landed** (DeployRegion type, ResidencyResolver
> staging arm, `StagingClamp` + email-delivery wiring, `StagingSeed` + boot
> wiring, the `deploy/api-staging/atlas.config.ts` variant, and the web staging
> banner). The **human-in-the-loop (HITL) infrastructure slices are still open** —

> OAuth apps, env-var population, and the prod cutover — along with the

> slice is marked **`pending slice NN (#issue)`**. Until those land, treat those
> sections as the intended procedure, not a record of what exists.

## Architecture at a glance

### URLs

| Surface | Staging                      | Prod                  |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| App     | `app.staging.useatlas.dev`   | `app.useatlas.dev`    |
| API     | `api.staging.useatlas.dev`   | `api.useatlas.dev`    |
| Landing | `www.staging.useatlas.dev`   | `useatlas.dev`        |

> **Subdomain order matters.** It is `api.staging.useatlas.dev`, not
> `staging.api.useatlas.dev`. The transposed form was a real bug
> ([#2969](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2969)). All three staging
> hosts share the `.staging.useatlas.dev` parent so their session cookies stay
> isolated from prod's `.useatlas.dev` namespace.

### How you know you're on staging

The web app shell renders a full-width **amber "Staging environment" banner** on
every page (including pre-sign-in) whenever the API reports it is the staging
deploy. It is driven by `StagingBanner`
(`packages/web/src/ui/components/staging-banner.tsx`), which reads `region` from
the public `GET /api/health` response:

- The API stamps `region: "staging"` when `ATLAS_API_REGION=staging` (resolved by
  `getApiRegion()` in `packages/api/src/lib/residency/misrouting.ts`, surfaced in
  `health.ts`).
- The banner renders nothing on production regions (`us` | `eu` | `apac`) and on
  self-hosted/dev deploys (no region), so there is no layout shift outside
  staging.
- The same region is also exposed (auth-gated) on `GET /api/v1/mode` as
  `deployRegion` (slice 3, [#2909](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2909)).
  `/api/health` is the canonical pre-auth signal; `/api/v1/mode` is for the
  in-app developer-mode UX.

If you ever see a tab with **no** amber banner that you *think* is staging, treat
it as production until proven otherwise — check `GET /api/health` directly.

### Outbound mail is clamped to a sink

Staging runs the **real** email-delivery code against real providers (Resend,
etc.), so without a guard a soak could email real-looking customer addresses and
burn sender reputation. Every outbound email is therefore redirected to a single
sink before the provider send (**slice 5, [#2913](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2913) —
landed**):

- `sendEmail` (`packages/api/src/lib/email/delivery.ts`) routes every message
  through `clampOutbound` (`packages/api/src/lib/staging/clamp.ts`), which
  rewrites the recipient to `STAGING_MAIL_SINK` (default
  `staging-mail@useatlas.dev`). Subject, body, and headers are preserved.
- The clamp is **fail-closed** ([#2985](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2985)):
  it keys off `ATLAS_DEPLOY_ENV=staging` (the authoritative soak-box signal), so
  a misconfigured or fat-fingered `ATLAS_API_REGION` — even a *valid* prod value
  like `us` — cannot silently disable it. On a staging-shaped deploy, mail is
  **always** clamped.
- Boot **hard-fails** if a staging deploy doesn't also stamp
  `ATLAS_API_REGION=staging` (`assertStagingMailRegion`, wired into
  `StagingSeedLive`). A mislabeled staging box never serves — it exits non-zero
  at boot rather than risk real mail.
- If a staging box ever sends an email while `ATLAS_API_REGION` has drifted from
  `staging`, the wiring layer logs a warn (keys only — no recipient/body) so the
  drift is visible; fix it by setting `ATLAS_API_REGION=staging` on the service.

> **cc / bcc / replyTo are not yet redirected** — the current `EmailMessage` has
> only `to`. Adding any new recipient field means extending the clamp too
> ([#2984](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2984)).

### Deploy trigger model

| Branch / ref          | Target                                     | Trigger                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `main`                | staging (api / app / www)                  | every merge, automatically                     |
| `v*.*.*` tag → `prod` | prod (api / api-eu / api-apac / web / www) | `/release` fast-forwards `prod` to the tag SHA |
| `docs`                | docs.useatlas.dev                          | direct from `main`                             |

The `prod` branch is a Railway-tracking artifact advanced only by `/release`
(`git push origin <tag-sha>^{}:prod --force-with-lease`). No PRs target `prod`.
See [release-process.md § Mental model](./release-process.md#mental-model).

### Railway topology (target shape)

Same Railway project (`satisfied-creation`), new environment `staging`, four new
resources:

- `api-staging` — Hono API service
- `web-staging` — Next.js service
- `www-staging` — Caddy static landing
- `staging-postgres` — Railway-managed Postgres (Atlas internal DB)

There is **no** staging `docs` service (docs deploys direct from `main`) and
**no** staging sandbox sidecar — staging shares the prod Vercel Sandbox, which is
a per-request Firecracker microVM with `networkPolicy: "deny-all"`, so cross-env
contamination is structurally impossible.

## 1. Railway setup

> References slices 19 ([#2907](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2907)),
> 20 ([#2916](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2916)), and
> 21 ([#2917](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2917)) — all **HITL,
> pending**. Run these in order; each depends on the previous.

### 1a. Create the `staging` environment — *pending slice 19 (#2907)*

1. Open the `satisfied-creation` project in the [Railway dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard).
2. **New Environment** → name it `staging`. Do **not** fork from `production` if
   that would copy prod secrets — staging credentials are a hard wall (see
   [§3](#3-env-var-checklist)). Start from an empty environment and populate vars
   explicitly.
3. Confirm the environment selector shows `staging` before creating any service.

> 📸 _Screenshot placeholder: Railway project → New Environment dialog with name `staging`._

### 1b. Provision the managed Postgres — *pending slice 19 (#2907)*

1. In the `staging` environment, **New** → **Database** → **Add PostgreSQL**.
   Name it `staging-postgres`.
2. Railway exposes `DATABASE_URL` as a service variable. Reference it from
   `api-staging` (see [§3](#3-env-var-checklist)) — do **not** hardcode the
   connection string.
3. This Postgres is the Atlas **internal** DB only (auth, audit, settings). The
   **analytics** datasource is the shared `__demo__` NovaMart connection
   (`ATLAS_DATASOURCE_URL`) — staging does not get its own analytics DB.

> 📸 _Screenshot placeholder: Railway staging env with the `staging-postgres` service provisioned._

### 1c. Clone the three runtime services — *pending slice 20 (#2916)*

Create `api-staging`, `web-staging`, and `www-staging` from the same GitHub repo
as their prod counterparts (`api`, `web`, `www`):

1. **New** → **GitHub Repo** → `AtlasDevHQ/atlas`.
2. For each service set:
   - **Root directory / Dockerfile** — match the prod service's build config
     (the `deploy/<service>` layout). `api-staging` uses its own
     `deploy/api-staging/atlas.config.ts` — **landed (slice 8,
     [#2912](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2912) /
     [#3087](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/3087))**. Use it; do
     **not** point `api-staging` at the prod `deploy/api/atlas.config.ts`: that
     config declares `eu`/`apac` residency entries whose `databaseUrl` resolves
     from `ATLAS_REGION_EU_DB_URL` / `ATLAS_REGION_APAC_DB_URL` (non-null-asserted),
     and config validation rejects an empty region URL — so `api-staging`, which
     starts from an empty Railway environment, would fail to boot. The dedicated
     staging config avoids that by declaring only the `staging` region.
   - **Watch branch** — `main` (this is what makes every merge auto-deploy to
     staging). Prod services watch `prod`; staging services watch `main`.
   - **Wait for CI** — optional; staging is the soak, so deploying ahead of CI is
     acceptable.
3. Populate each service's env vars per [§3](#3-env-var-checklist) before the
   first successful boot — `api-staging` boots loud on missing required secrets.

### 1d. Wire the CNAMEs — *pending slice 20 (#2916)*

For each staging service, add a custom domain in Railway and a matching CNAME in
the `useatlas.dev` DNS zone:

| Host                       | Railway service | DNS record                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `api.staging.useatlas.dev` | `api-staging`   | CNAME → Railway-provided target         |
| `app.staging.useatlas.dev` | `web-staging`   | CNAME → Railway-provided target         |
| `www.staging.useatlas.dev` | `www-staging`   | CNAME → Railway-provided target         |

1. In Railway: service → **Settings** → **Networking** → **Custom Domain** →
   enter the host. Railway returns a CNAME target.
2. In DNS: add the CNAME pointing at Railway's target. Wait for propagation +
   Railway's TLS issuance to go green.
3. Verify: `curl -I https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/health` returns `200`.

> 📸 _Screenshot placeholder: Railway Custom Domain panel showing `api.staging.useatlas.dev` issued, alongside the DNS provider's CNAME record._

> **Peer symmetry.** `api.staging.useatlas.dev` is peer-symmetric with
> `api.useatlas.dev` / `api-eu.useatlas.dev` / `api-apac.useatlas.dev`. Keeping
> the shape identical is what lets OAuth callback URLs and CORS allow-lists be
> derived the same way across regions.

## 2. OAuth & provider apps

> References slices 12–18 ([#2900](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2900)–[#2906](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2906)),
> all **HITL, pending**. Each provider gets a **separate staging app** — never
> reuse prod credentials. Every callback URL points at
> `api.staging.useatlas.dev`. After creating each app, record its secrets and
> set them in the `api-staging` Railway service ([§3](#3-env-var-checklist)).

The integration OAuth callback path convention is
`https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/v1/integrations/<slug>/callback`, where
`<slug>` is the **catalog slug** (e.g. `github-data`, not `github`). The
Better Auth **social-login** callback convention is
`https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/auth/callback/<provider>` (Google, GitHub
social sign-in). Confirm the exact path against each handler before submitting it
to the provider.

> **`ATLAS_PUBLIC_API_URL` must be set for any of these OAuth handlers to
> register.** `resolvePublicApiUrl()` in `register.ts` builds every redirect URI
> from `ATLAS_PUBLIC_API_URL`; when it is unset, the Slack/Linear/Salesforce/GitHub
> handlers log "not registered" at boot and their install routes return 501.
> `ATLAS_CORS_ORIGIN` is intentionally **not** a fallback (it's the web origin,
> which mismatches the provider redirect URI in split-origin deploys). Set
> `ATLAS_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.staging.useatlas.dev` on `api-staging` — see
> [§3](#3-env-var-checklist).

### 2a. Slack — *pending slice 12 (#2900)*

- **Console:** <https://api.slack.com/apps> → **Create New App** → **From an app
  manifest**. Clone the prod `atlas` app's manifest, rename to `atlas-staging`.
- **Docs:** [Slack OAuth v2](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2) ·
  [App manifests](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests)
- **Redirect URL:** `https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/v1/integrations/slack/callback`
- **Env vars produced:** `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`, `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`,
  `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, and a fresh 32-byte `SLACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (encrypts
  bot tokens in `chat_cache`; generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`).

### 2b. Linear — *pending slice 13 (#2901)*

- **Console:** <https://linear.app/settings/api> → **OAuth Applications** → **New
  OAuth Application** named `atlas-staging`.
- **Docs:** [Linear OAuth 2.0 authentication](https://developers.linear.app/docs/oauth/authentication)
- **Scopes:** at minimum `read`, `write`, `issues:create`.
- **Redirect URL:** `https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/v1/integrations/linear/callback`
- **Env vars produced:** `LINEAR_CLIENT_ID`, `LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET`.

> 📸 _Screenshot placeholder: Linear OAuth Application form with the staging callback and scopes._

### 2c. GitHub — *pending slice 14 (#2902)*

Atlas uses GitHub in two distinct ways; staging may need either or both:

1. **GitHub App** — backs **both** the `github` action integration **and** the
   `github-data` OAuth datasource (they reuse the same `GITHUB_APP_*`
   registration). Create a **separate** GitHub App named `atlas-staging` with its
   own webhook URL.
   - **Console:** <https://github.com/settings/apps> → **New GitHub App**
   - **Docs:** [Creating GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app)
   - **Callback URLs — register *both* on the App** (the handlers build distinct
     redirect URIs per slug in `register.ts`, so a single callback won't serve
     both):
     - `https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/v1/integrations/github-data/callback`
       — the **datasource** install handler (slug `github-data`).
     - `https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/v1/integrations/github/callback`
       — the **action integration** handler (slug `github`).
   - **Env vars produced:** `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_SLUG`,
     `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (the `.pem` contents), `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`,
     `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`. All five are required, and `ATLAS_PUBLIC_API_URL`
     must be set (the redirect URI is resolved from it — see [§3](#3-env-var-checklist));
     otherwise the handlers log "not registered" and the install routes return
     501.
     > ⚠️ These `GITHUB_APP_*` vars are read by `register.ts` but are **not yet
     > documented in `.env.example`** — see [§7 Incidental findings](#7-incidental-findings).
2. **GitHub social login** (Better Auth sign-in). A separate OAuth App
   (not GitHub App).
   - **Console:** <https://github.com/settings/developers> → **OAuth Apps** →
     **New OAuth App**
   - **Authorization callback URL:** `https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/auth/callback/github`
   - **Env vars produced:** `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

> 📸 _Screenshot placeholder: GitHub App settings → Identifying information (App ID) and the webhook/callback URL._

### 2d. Google — *pending slice 15 (#2903)*

- **Console:** [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
  → use the **same GCP project as prod**, create a **separate OAuth 2.0 Client
  ID** for staging.
- **Docs:** [Setting up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849) ·
  [Using OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)
- **Authorized redirect URI:** `https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/auth/callback/google`
- **Env vars produced:** `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

> 📸 _Screenshot placeholder: GCP Credentials → OAuth client → Authorized redirect URIs with the staging URI._

### 2e. Twenty CRM — *pending slice 16 (#2904)*

- **Console:** [Twenty Cloud](https://twenty.com/) → create a **separate
  workspace** for staging (do not share the prod `crm.useatlas.dev` workspace) →
  **Settings → API & Webhooks → Generate API Key**.
- **Docs:** [Twenty developers / REST API](https://twenty.com/developers)
- **Required schema:** the Twenty `Person` object must have the custom fields
  `atlasFirstSource` **and** `atlasLastSource` (verified at Atlas boot).
- **Env vars produced:** `TWENTY_API_KEY`, `TWENTY_BASE_URL` (the staging
  workspace REST base URL). The boot-time `StagingSeed` Twenty install and the
  smoke harness read the parallel `STAGING_TWENTY_API_KEY` /
  `STAGING_TWENTY_BASE_URL` (see [§4](#4-smoke-test-webhook-wiring) and
  [§7](#7-incidental-findings)).

> 📸 _Screenshot placeholder: Twenty Settings → API & Webhooks → API key generation, and the Person object's custom fields._

### 2f. Stripe — *pending slice 17 (#2905)*

- **Console:** [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) — toggle **Test
  mode**. Register a **test-mode webhook endpoint** pointing at the staging API.
- **Docs:** [Stripe webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) ·
  [Test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode)
- **Webhook endpoint URL:** the Better Auth Stripe plugin mounts the webhook
  under the auth namespace (`https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/auth/stripe/webhook`).
  Confirm the exact path against the `@better-auth/stripe` plugin mount in
  `packages/api/src/lib/auth/server.ts` before registering.
- **Env vars produced:** `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (`sk_test_…`),
  `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (`whsec_…` for the staging endpoint), and the
  **test-mode** price IDs `STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID`,
  `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`,
  `STRIPE_PRO_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_BUSINESS_PRICE_ID`,
  `STRIPE_BUSINESS_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID`.

> 📸 _Screenshot placeholder: Stripe → Developers → Webhooks (Test mode) showing the staging endpoint + signing secret._

### 2g. Resend — *pending slice 18 (#2906)*

- **Console:** [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/) → create a **separate API
  key** for staging and verify the sender domain `staging.useatlas.dev`.
- **Docs:** [Resend domains](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction) ·
  [Resend API keys](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/api-keys/introduction)
- **Env vars produced:** `RESEND_API_KEY`. Pair with `ATLAS_EMAIL_FROM` set to a
  `staging.useatlas.dev` sender.
- **Safety net:** `StagingClamp` is wired into email delivery (**slice 5,
  [#2913](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2913) — landed**), so every
  outbound email's `to` is rewritten to `STAGING_MAIL_SINK` (default
  `staging-mail@useatlas.dev`) before it reaches Resend — staging cannot email
  real recipients even if a test seeds a real address. See
  [Outbound mail is clamped to a sink](#outbound-mail-is-clamped-to-a-sink).

## 3. Env var checklist

Set these on the `api-staging` (and where noted, `web-staging`) Railway service
([§3](#3-env-var-checklist) of slice 21, [#2917](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2917) —
**pending**). The list below is **exhaustive against `.env.example`** — every
entry in that file is accounted for here. Legend:

- 🔒 **Per-env secret (hard wall)** — generate/obtain a **distinct** staging
  value; never copy prod.
- ♻️ **Share with prod** — the same value as prod is acceptable (no tenant data
  risk).
- 🟦 **Staging-specific value** — a non-secret set to a staging-shaped value
  (URLs, region, cookie prefix).
- ⚪ **Default / unset** — leave at the documented default or unset in staging.

### Core runtime & datasource

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | 🟦 | Reference `staging-postgres`'s Railway-provided URL. |
| `ATLAS_DATASOURCE_URL` | ♻️ | The shared `__demo__` NovaMart connection (same analytics data as prod's demo). |

### LLM provider

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `ATLAS_PROVIDER`, `ATLAS_MODEL` | ♻️ | Same provider + model as prod. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | ♻️ | Same key as prod (model calls carry no customer data risk in staging). A separate key is fine if you want isolated billing/quota. |
| `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | ⚪ | Only if `ATLAS_PROVIDER=bedrock`; otherwise unset. |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` | ⚪ | Only for self-host provider modes; unset on SaaS staging. |

### Authentication & Better Auth

### Demo data & demo mode

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `ATLAS_DEMO_DATA` | ⚪ | Unset — staging uses the shared `__demo__` connection via `ATLAS_DATASOURCE_URL`, not the internal-DB-as-datasource shortcut. |

### Networking, CORS, URLs

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `ATLAS_PUBLIC_API_URL` | 🟦 | **`https://api.staging.useatlas.dev` — required.** `resolvePublicApiUrl()` builds every OAuth install handler's redirect URI from this; unset ⇒ Slack/Linear/GitHub/Salesforce install routes return 501 ([§2](#2-oauth--provider-apps)). Referenced in `.env.example` prose but not a declared entry — see [§7](#7-incidental-findings). |
| `ATLAS_PUBLIC_URL` | 🟦 | `https://api.staging.useatlas.dev`. Distinct from `ATLAS_PUBLIC_API_URL` — this one is the action-approval URL base; it is **not** a fallback for the OAuth redirect URI. |
| `ATLAS_CORS_ORIGIN` | 🟦 | `https://app.staging.useatlas.dev` (+ `www.staging.useatlas.dev` as needed). |
| `ATLAS_API_URL` | ⚪ | Dev rewrite target — unset in deployed staging. |
| `ATLAS_PUBLIC_WEB_URL` | 🟦 | `https://app.staging.useatlas.dev`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_API_URL` | 🟦🏗️ | `https://api.staging.useatlas.dev` (`web-staging`). **Build-time** — the `deploy/web/Dockerfile` already declares this as a build `ARG`; pass it as a Railway build arg, not just a runtime var. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_AUTH_MODE` | 🟦🏗️ | `managed` (`web-staging`). **Build-time** — already a `deploy/web/Dockerfile` build `ARG`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_COOKIE_PREFIX` | 🟦🏗️ | `atlas-staging` — **must equal** the API's `ATLAS_COOKIE_PREFIX`. **Build-time and load-bearing for prod/staging isolation:** `packages/web/src/proxy.ts` reads it as a static `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` inlined at build. The `deploy/web/Dockerfile` does **not** yet thread it as a build `ARG` (only `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_API_URL` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_AUTH_MODE`), so a runtime-only var leaves the proxy defaulting to `atlas` and treating prod's broadly-scoped cookie as a staging session. Threading this build arg needs a Dockerfile change — tracked in [§7](#7-incidental-findings). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_API_BASE` | 🟦🏗️ | `https://api.staging.useatlas.dev` (`www-staging`). **Build-time, www-only.** `apps/www/src/components/talk-to-sales-form.tsx` posts to `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_API_BASE ?? "https://api.useatlas.dev"`; unset ⇒ the staging landing page's talk-to-sales form submits to the **prod** API. Not in `.env.example` — see [§7](#7-incidental-findings). |

### Observability & runtime

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `ATLAS_LOG_LEVEL` | 🟦 | `info` (or `debug` while soaking). |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | ♻️ | Same collector as prod (spans carry a `deploy.region=staging` attribute, so staging traffic is filterable). |
| `ATLAS_MIGRATION_RETRIES` | ♻️ | Default `5`. |
| `ATLAS_RUNTIME` | ⚪ | Unset (not Vercel). |

### Sandbox / explore isolation

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `ATLAS_SANDBOX_URL` | ⚪ | Unset — staging has no sidecar; it shares the prod Vercel Sandbox priority via the config file. |
| `ATLAS_SANDBOX`, `ATLAS_SANDBOX_PRIORITY`, `ATLAS_SANDBOX_BACKEND` | ⚪ | Unset — SaaS pins `["vercel-sandbox"]` in the deploy config, not env. |
| `SIDECAR_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ATLAS_NSJAIL_PATH`, `ATLAS_NSJAIL_TIME_LIMIT`, `ATLAS_NSJAIL_MEMORY_LIMIT` | ⚪ | Unset (no sidecar / nsjail on SaaS staging). |
| `VERCEL_TEAM_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `VERCEL_TOKEN` | 🔒 | Required so off-Vercel `api-staging` can call `@vercel/sandbox`. Set **per-service** (Railway shared vars don't auto-inherit). Same Vercel team as prod; a staging-scoped token is preferable. |

### Action framework

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `ATLAS_ACTIONS_ENABLED`, `ATLAS_ACTION_APPROVAL`, `ATLAS_ACTION_TIMEOUT`, `ATLAS_ACTION_MAX_PER_CONVERSATION` | ♻️ | Mirror prod. |

### Chat & other integrations

| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`, `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SLACK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 🔒 | Staging Slack app ([§2a](#2a-slack--pending-slice-12-2900)). |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | ⚪ | Single-workspace mode — unset (staging uses multi-workspace OAuth). |
| `ATLAS_SLACK_INSTALL_TABLE` | ⚪ | Default `chat_cache` unless the chat plugin overrides `tablePrefix`. |
| `LINEAR_CLIENT_ID`, `LINEAR_CLIENT_SECRET` | 🔒 | Staging Linear app ([§2b](#2b-linear--pending-slice-13-2901)). |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` | ⚪ | Only if soaking Discord; staging app credentials if so. |
| `TEAMS_APP_ID` | ⚪ | Only if soaking Teams; per-org passwords live in the DB, not env. |
| `JIRA_BASE_URL`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, `JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT` | ⚪ | Manual-token Jira flow — unset unless soaking Jira actions. |
| `JIRA_CLIENT_ID`, `JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET` | ⚪ | Jira lazy-OAuth — staging Atlassian app if soaking; otherwise unset. |
| `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID`, `SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SALESFORCE_LOGIN_URL` | ⚪ | Only if soaking Salesforce; staging connected-app if so. |

### Stripe billing

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | 🔒 | `sk_test_…` ([§2f](#2f-stripe--pending-slice-17-2905)). |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | 🔒 | `whsec_…` for the staging test-mode webhook endpoint. |
| `STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_STARTER_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PRO_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_BUSINESS_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_BUSINESS_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID` | 🔒 | **Test-mode** price IDs from the staging Stripe account. |

### Data residency

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `ATLAS_API_REGION` | 🟦 | **`staging`** — the canonical region discriminator. Drives the banner, `ResidencyResolver` no-op arm, seed/clamp gating, and `/api/health`. |
| `ATLAS_STRICT_ROUTING` | ♻️ | Match prod. |
| `ATLAS_INTERNAL_SECRET` | 🔒 | Distinct staging cross-region secret (staging is excluded from the residency router, so this rarely fires — keep it isolated regardless). |

### Deploy mode

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `ATLAS_DEPLOY_MODE` | 🟦 | `saas` — staging exercises the full SaaS code path (enterprise gating, residency Tag, keyset enforcement). |
| `ATLAS_DEPLOY_ENV` | 🟦 | `staging` — drives non-secret per-env defaults (email-verification off, onboarding off, cookie prefix `atlas-staging`). |
| `ATLAS_COOKIE_PREFIX` | 🟦 | `atlas-staging` — must equal `web-staging`'s `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_COOKIE_PREFIX`. The prefix (not the cookie domain) is what isolates the staging session from prod's broadly-scoped `.useatlas.dev` cookie. |

### Enterprise & SaaS add-ons

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `ATLAS_ENTERPRISE_ENABLED`, `ATLAS_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY` | 🟦 | Enable if you want to soak enterprise surfaces; use a staging/non-prod license. |

| `ATLAS_SLA_LATENCY_P99_MS`, `ATLAS_SLA_ERROR_RATE_PCT`, `ATLAS_SLA_WEBHOOK_URL` | ⚪ | SLA monitoring — point the webhook at a staging channel if enabled, else unset. |
| `ATLAS_BACKUP_SCHEDULE`, `ATLAS_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`, `ATLAS_BACKUP_STORAGE_PATH` | ⚪ | Backups — default/unset unless soaking backups. |
| `ATLAS_BACKUP_VERIFY_SCRATCH_URL` | ⚪ | Only with a **disposable** scratch DB (it WIPES on every run); never point at the staging or any real DB. |

### Status page & sub-processors

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATUS_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENSTATUS_SLUG` | ⚪ | Optional; unset on staging or point at a staging status feed. |
| `ATLAS_SUBPROCESSORS_URL`, `ATLAS_SUBPROCESSOR_PUBLISH_INTERVAL_MS` | ⚪ | Default (publisher mirrors SaaS config). |

### Railway custom domains (enterprise feature)

| Var(s) | Class | Staging value source |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------- |
| `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`, `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`, `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID`, `RAILWAY_WEB_SERVICE_ID` | 🔒 | Only if staging exercises the custom-domain feature. Use the `staging` environment ID and `web-staging` service ID; the token stays workspace-scoped. |

> **Staging-only env vars not in `.env.example`.** `StagingSeed` and the smoke

## 4. Smoke-test webhook wiring

> References slice 10 ([#2898](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2898)) —
> `.github/workflows/staging-smoke.yml` is **pending**. The flow below is the
> intended wiring.

The chain is: **Railway staging-deploy success → GitHub `repository_dispatch` →
`staging-smoke.yml`.**

1. **Railway notifies GitHub on a successful staging deploy.** Configure a
   Railway deploy webhook (or a deploy-success step) on the `api-staging` service
   to POST a GitHub `repository_dispatch` with event type
   **`staging-deploy-success`**:

   ```bash
   curl -fsS -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $GH_DISPATCH_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/dispatches \
     -d '{"event_type":"staging-deploy-success"}'
   ```

   The `GH_DISPATCH_TOKEN` must be able to **write** the dispatch: a
   fine-grained PAT needs **`Contents: write`** repository permission (GitHub
   requires write for `repository_dispatch` — see the
   [REST docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event));
   a read-only token is rejected. A classic PAT needs the `repo` scope. Store it
   as a Railway secret.

2. **`staging-smoke.yml` listens for the dispatch** (*pending slice 10*):

   ```yaml
   on:
     repository_dispatch:
       types: [staging-deploy-success]
   ```

3. **The job runs two checks:**
   - **Health + region:**
     ```bash
     curl -fsS https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/health | jq -e '.region == "staging"'
     ```
     This confirms the deploy landed and the region discriminator is set. The
     route is public — no auth, no API code change needed.
   - **CRM smoke:**
     ```bash
     bun run atlas -- ops smoke-crm --personas ./scripts/staging-smoke-personas.yml
     ```
     with `TWENTY_API_KEY=$STAGING_TWENTY_API_KEY`,
     `TWENTY_BASE_URL=$STAGING_TWENTY_BASE_URL`, and
     `DATABASE_URL=$STAGING_DATABASE_URL` in the job env. The CLI talks directly
     to Twenty + Postgres (not through the staging API host). The personas
     fixture `scripts/staging-smoke-personas.yml` is committed alongside the
     workflow (*pending slice 10*).

4. **Result posts to Slack.** The pass/fail is posted to the maintainer's Slack
   via the existing chat plugin (re-using the `#sandbox-atlas` dogfood channel
   pattern), so the on-call sees whether the last merge is safe to tag without
   opening Railway.

**Interpreting a red signal:**

| Failure | Likely cause |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `curl` non-200 | `api-staging` didn't boot / CNAME or TLS not ready / health route down. |
| `.region != "staging"` | `ATLAS_API_REGION` not set to `staging` on `api-staging`. |
| `smoke-crm` fails | Staging Twenty key/URL wrong, `Person` custom fields missing, or the `crm_outbox` flusher wedged. |

---

## 5. Resetting the staging DB — `atlas ops wipe`

When staging accumulates drift, reset its internal DB with the operator wipe
subcommand. It is **destructive** and **takes no backup**.

```bash
ATLAS_WIPE_OK=1 bun run atlas -- ops wipe --confirm --database-url "$STAGING_DATABASE_URL"
```

- **Double gate.** The command refuses to run unless **both**
  `ATLAS_WIPE_OK=1` (exactly the string `1` — `true`/`yes` are rejected) **and**
  `--confirm` are present. This is intentional; one gate is too easy to trip.
- **No backup is taken.** `ops wipe` `TRUNCATE`s every table in the target's
  `public` schema (excluding migration bookkeeping). If you want a snapshot first,
  wrap it yourself: `pg_dump "$STAGING_DATABASE_URL" > staging-pre-wipe.sql`.
- **One DB per invocation.** Point `--database-url` at the **staging** DB
  explicitly. Without it the command targets `ATLAS_TEAM_PG_URL` (falling back to
  `DATABASE_URL`) — double-check you are not pointed at prod.
- **Reseed is automatic.** On the next `api-staging` boot, `ensureStagingSeed`
  re-creates the `staging-internal` org, the deterministic admin
  (`admin@staging.useatlas.dev` / `STAGING_ADMIN_PASSWORD`), the `__demo__`
  datasource, and (if `STAGING_TWENTY_*` are set) the Twenty install. The seed is
  idempotent, so a boot against a non-empty DB is a no-op.

> **Never run `ops wipe` against a prod region DB.** The staging DB is wipe-on-
> demand by design; prod is not. Confirm the `--database-url` host before adding
> `--confirm`.

## 6. Cutover playbook — moving prod onto the tag pattern

> References slice 22 ([#2918](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2918)) —
> **HITL**. This is the one-time switch that flips prod from "every `main` push
> deploys" to "only a release tag deploys."

**This already happened.** Per [release-process.md](./release-process.md), the
dual trigger went **live with `v0.0.1`** (wired in
[#2921](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues/2921)): prod already watches
the `prod` branch, advanced only by `/release` — the pre-`v0.0.1`
main-to-prod autodeploy is **retired**. A merge to `main` no longer reaches
customers on its own. The steps below document the cutover procedure for
reference and re-verification; the remaining slice-22 scope is confirming that
**every** prod service — including `www` — is on `prod` (not `main`).

**Steps:**

1. **Pre-flight.** Confirm staging is fully green: all three staging services
   deployed, `GET /api/health` returns `region: "staging"`, and a smoke run
   passed. Don't cut over onto a broken staging.
2. **Create the `prod` branch at the current prod SHA.** It must point at exactly
   what prod is running right now:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git push origin <current-prod-SHA>:refs/heads/prod
   ```
   (Branch protection treats `prod` as a Railway-tracking artifact — no PRs, only
   `/release` advances it.)
3. **Repoint each prod service to `prod`.** In Railway, for `api`, `api-eu`,
   `api-apac`, `web`, **and** `www` (www IS gated — CSP/embed/origin changes are
   exactly the class staging catches): **Settings → Source → Branch** → change
   `main` to `prod`. Leave `docs` on `main` (direct-from-main, no runtime
   surface).
4. **Bridge the gap immediately with the first tag.** Any PR merged on cutover
   day *after* the flip but *before* the first prod tag won't reach prod until a
   tag fires. The first regular tag (`v0.0.1`, cut 2026-05-29) closed this window
   right after the flip — this is why cutover and the first `/release` were a
   single coordinated step. If you ever re-run a cutover, push the next tag in
   train (`/release`) immediately after repointing.
5. **Verify lineage.** `git rev-parse origin/prod` should equal the tagged SHA,
   and the five prod services should show a fresh deploy sourced from `prod`.
6. **Update the memory + docs.** Cutover is reflected in the
   `feedback_no_staging_env` / staging-environment memory ("staging shipped —
   see `docs/development/staging-environment.md`"), and `release-process.md`
   documents the now-live dual trigger.

**Rollback during cutover.** If a prod service misbehaves on the first
`prod`-sourced deploy, Railway's per-service health-check rollback restores the
prior image for that region while the others proceed. To revert the whole
experiment, repoint the services back to `main` — but only as an emergency; the
intended end state is all five prod services on `prod`.

for "I tagged but prod didn't deploy" once cutover is complete.

## 7. Incidental findings

Building the env-var checklist (and the Codex review of this PR) surfaced
`.env.example` and deploy-config gaps. Per project convention these are **filed
as issues, not fixed inline in this PR**:

1. **`STAGING_*` family undocumented.** `StagingSeed`
   (`packages/api/src/lib/staging/seed.ts`) and the smoke harness read
   `STAGING_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `STAGING_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `STAGING_MAIL_SINK`,
   `STAGING_TWENTY_API_KEY`, and `STAGING_TWENTY_BASE_URL` from the environment,
   but none appear in `.env.example`.
2. **`GITHUB_APP_*` family undocumented.** The `github`/`github-data` OAuth
   handlers (`packages/api/src/lib/integrations/install/register.ts`) read
   `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_SLUG`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`,
   `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`, and `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`, distinct from the
   social-login `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`/`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` that the file does
   document.
3. **`ATLAS_PUBLIC_API_URL` not a declared entry.** It is the **required** base
   for every OAuth install handler's redirect URI (`resolvePublicApiUrl()`), yet
   it only appears in `.env.example` prose, not as its own `# ATLAS_PUBLIC_API_URL=`
   entry.
4. **`NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_API_BASE` absent.** `apps/www`'s talk-to-sales form
   (`apps/www/src/components/talk-to-sales-form.tsx`) falls back to the prod API
   when this is unset; it appears nowhere in `.env.example`.
5. **`deploy/web/Dockerfile` doesn't thread `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_COOKIE_PREFIX` as a
   build arg.** `packages/web/src/proxy.ts` reads it at build time, but the
   Dockerfile only declares `ARG`s for `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_API_URL` and
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_ATLAS_AUTH_MODE` — so a staging cookie prefix set only at runtime
   silently defaults to `atlas`, defeating prod/staging session isolation. Needs
   a Dockerfile (build-arg) change.

## Operational rules

- **New integrations start on staging.** When adding a chat platform, action
  target, or datasource, create the staging app/credentials first and soak there.
  Never OAuth-register a new platform straight against prod.
- **Staging mirrors prod config, not prod data.** Don't assume staging shares a
  database or secrets with prod; provision its own. The lone shared resource is
  the read-only `__demo__` analytics datasource.
- **A red staging run blocks the tag.** `/ci` runs before a release tag is cut,
  and a staging regression should be caught and fixed on `main` before
  `/release`.

## Quick smoke check (manual)

After a `main` merge deploys to staging:

1. Load `app.staging.useatlas.dev` — confirm the amber banner is present.
2. `curl https://api.staging.useatlas.dev/api/health` — confirm `200` and
   `"region":"staging"` in the body.
3. Sign in with the seeded admin and run a query end-to-end against the staging
   datasource.
4. Trigger an email (e.g. a password reset) and confirm it lands in the
   `STAGING_MAIL_SINK` inbox, **never** the real recipient — the outbound clamp
   is working.
