/**
 * Minimal type declarations for @vercel/sandbox ^2.x (optional dependency).
 * These declarations provide type safety on environments where the optional
 * package is not installed (e.g., self-hosted Docker deployments).
 * When @vercel/sandbox is installed, its own types take precedence.
 *
 * Last synced with: @vercel/sandbox@2.0.2 SDK reference
 *
 * v2 migration notes (only the surface Atlas uses is mirrored here):
 *  - `Sandbox` stays the public class — v2 ADDED `Session` (the inner running
 *    VM) but did NOT rename `Sandbox`. `create`/`runCommand`/`mkDir`/
 *    `writeFiles`/`stop`/`updateNetworkPolicy` all survive.
 *  - `writeFiles` content widened to `string | Uint8Array` (+ optional `mode`);
 *    `Buffer` (what Atlas passes) is a `Uint8Array`, so it still satisfies it.
 *  - `stop()` now resolves to session/snapshot metadata, not the `Sandbox`.
 *    Atlas ignores the return, so it is typed loosely here.
 *  - `updateNetworkPolicy` is `@deprecated` upstream in favour of
 *    `update({ networkPolicy })`. We deliberately keep calling it (it still
 *    works in v2, no lint rule flags it) so this dep bump stays minimal and the
 *    `Parameters<updateNetworkPolicy>[0]` security invariant in
 *    `tools/backends/network-allowlist.ts` is preserved verbatim. The `@deprecated`
 *    tag is intentionally NOT mirrored here. Migrating to `.update()` is a
 *    tracked follow-up.
 *
 * v2 ergonomics adopted in #3126 (only the members actually used are added):
 *  - `Sandbox.create()` resolves to `Sandbox & AsyncDisposable`, so the
 *    create-and-dispose-in-one-scope backends (`tools/explore-sandbox.ts`, the
 *    `@useatlas/vercel-sandbox` plugin) can use `await using` /
 *    `AsyncDisposableStack` instead of a hand-rolled `try/finally` + `stop()`.
 *  - `readFileToBuffer({ path })` reads a file off the sandbox FS as a `Buffer`
 *    (or `null` if missing) — `tools/python-sandbox.ts` uses it to read the
 *    structured result + chart PNGs directly, replacing the stdout result-marker.
 *  - `fs` exposes a `node:fs/promises`-compatible surface; only `readdir`
 *    (listing chart PNGs) is mirrored. `downloadFile` and the rest of `fs` are
 *    intentionally omitted — Atlas does not use them.
