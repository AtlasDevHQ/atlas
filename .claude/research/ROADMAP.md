## North Star: 1.0.0 — SaaS Launch

Atlas 1.0.0 = hosted SaaS at **app.useatlas.dev**. Target: later 2026. Every milestone below is a stepping stone toward a production multi-tenant SaaS that teams sign up for, connect their database, and start querying — no deploy step.

The AGPL license makes the SaaS the natural path for commercial users. Self-hosted remains free and fully functional. The hosted product adds managed infrastructure, onboarding, monitoring, and support.

## 0.6.0 — Governance & Operational Hardening

**SaaS prerequisite: operators must trust Atlas with real workloads before it can be a hosted product.** Close half-built gaps, add governance primitives, and harden for multi-user production environments.

### Finish Half-Built Infrastructure

These are already partially implemented in the codebase — reserve status, DB schema, or env var parsing exists, but enforcement doesn't.

- [x] Action timeout enforcement (#448, PR #468) — enforce `ATLAS_ACTION_TIMEOUT` in action executor, transition to `timed_out` status after expiry
- [x] Rollback API for actions (#451, PR #476) — `POST /api/v1/actions/:id/rollback` endpoint, `rolled_back` status, admin UI rollback button, SDK `rollbackAction()`
- [x] Configurable agent step limit (#449, PR #467) — `ATLAS_AGENT_MAX_STEPS` env var (default 25, range 1–100)
- [x] Configurable Python blocked imports (#452, PR #472) — `python.blockedModules` and `python.allowModules` config arrays with critical module protection
- [x] Configurable explore backend priority (#453, PR #474) — `sandbox.priority` config array overrides hardcoded backend selection order

### Access Control

- [x] RLS improvements (#456, PR #488) — multi-column policies, array claim support, OR-logic between policies
- [x] Session management (#457, PR #501) — admin + user session listing, revoke individual/all, idle and absolute timeout policies, admin UI page
- [x] Social provider setup guide (#463, PR #486) — Google, GitHub, Microsoft

### Audit & Compliance

- [x] Audit log improvements (#458, PR #487, #493) — CSV export, full-text search, connection/table filtering
- [x] Data classification tags on query audit trails (#460, PR #498) — `tables_accessed` and `columns_accessed` arrays extracted from validated AST, stored with audit entries, filterable in admin UI

### Plugin Ecosystem

- [x] Replace `unknown` escape hatches with typed optional peer deps (#454, PR #473) — `@useatlas/plugin-sdk/ai` and `@useatlas/plugin-sdk/hono` type re-exports with optional peer deps
- [x] Plugin hooks: `beforeToolCall` / `afterToolCall` (#450, PR #469) — allow plugins to intercept agent tool decisions. Enables compliance gates, cost controls, and custom routing
- [x] Custom query validation hook on `PluginDBConnection` (#455, PR #475) — async `validate?(query: string)` for non-SQL datasources. Replaces `validateSQL` when present

### SDK Surface

- [x] `validateSQL(sql)` (#461, PR #485) — `POST /api/v1/validate-sql` endpoint + SDK method. Validates without executing
- [x] `getAuditLog()` (#462, PR #485) — SDK method wrapping admin audit endpoint with filters

### Collaboration

- [x] Semantic layer diff in UI (#464, PR #503) — `GET /api/v1/admin/semantic/diff` endpoint, admin UI page with color-coded diff (new/removed/changed tables and columns), multi-connection support

### Integrations

- [x] Microsoft Teams interaction plugin (#465, PR #499) — `@useatlas/teams` with Bot Framework messaging, Adaptive Cards, JWT verification, @mention handling
- [x] Webhook interaction plugin (#459, PR #500) — `@useatlas/webhook` with API key + HMAC auth, sync and async modes, structured JSON responses
- [x] Email digest plugin (#466, PR #502) — `@useatlas/email-digest` with subscription CRUD, daily/weekly scheduling, multi-metric aggregation, HTML email templates

## 0.7.0 — Performance & Multi-Tenancy

**SaaS prerequisite: a hosted product needs to serve multiple customers efficiently on shared infrastructure.** No backwards compatibility needed — zero external users, rip and replace freely. Better Auth organization plugin provides the tenant boundary; everything scopes to `activeOrganizationId`.

### Organization Foundation (P0 — do first, everything depends on this)

- [x] Better Auth organization plugin (#514, PR #517) — `organization()` plugin with `activeOrganizationId` on session, org CRUD + member management + invitations, RBAC (owner/admin/member), org switcher UI, first-run org creation flow, all data endpoints scoped to active org

### Caching

- [x] Query result caching (#504, PR #521) — LRU cache with SHA-256 keys (SQL + orgId + connectionId + claims), configurable TTL, admin flush endpoint, plugin hook for external backends (Redis), cache hit/miss headers
- [x] Cache admin UI (#505, PR #527) — admin page with hit rate, entry count, max size, TTL, and flush button with confirmation dialog

### Semantic Layer Indexing

- [x] Pre-computed semantic index at boot (#506, PR #515) — keyword extraction from entities, inverted index, relevant subset injected into agent system prompt based on question keywords
- [x] `atlas index` CLI command (#507, PR #533) — rebuild semantic index on demand with summary stats, `--stats` flag for read-only info

### Multi-Tenancy (all depend on #514)

- [x] Org-scoped semantic layers (#508, PR #524) — DB-backed `semantic_entities` table keyed by orgId, admin CRUD API, file YAML import as seed, org-scoped table whitelist in SQL validation
- [x] Org-scoped explore tool (#522, PR #525) — DB-backed filesystem with dual-write sync layer, atomic file writes, per-org backend caching in explore tool, sidecar cwd support, boot reconciliation
- [x] `atlas init` dual-write + import (#523, PR #526) — disk→DB import endpoint, `atlas import` CLI command, org-scoped `atlas init` with auto-import, first-boot auto-import from disk
- [x] Org-scoped connection pooling (#509, PR #529) — per-org pool isolation keyed by orgId + connectionId, lazy creation, configurable limits, health-based drain, per-org metrics via admin API
- [x] Org isolation validation (#510, PR #528) — 27 tests proving SQL whitelist, semantic index, cache keys, explore root, conversations, and audit never cross org boundaries
- [x] Pool capacity guard bug (#530, PR #534) — capacity check now includes org pool slots, config validation warns on overcapacity
- [x] Tenant pool integration tests (#531, PR #534) — org routing tests in sql.test.ts, admin pool endpoint tests, config validation tests
- [x] Pool misconfiguration health check (#536, PR #537) — surface capacity warnings in admin health endpoint
- [x] Shared connection mock factory (#535, PR #538) — reduce test maintenance burden across 20+ test files
- [x] Fix hooks-integration and custom-validation tests (#532) — already fixed by shared mock factory (PR #538)

### Infrastructure

- [x] Connection pooling improvements (#511, PR #516) — warmup at startup, health-based drain on error threshold, pool metrics (active/idle/waiting) exposed via admin API and health dashboard
- [x] Streaming Python execution output (#512) — progressive stdout chunks and chart renders via sidecar SSE protocol

### Learning (Phase 1)

- [x] `atlas learn` CLI (#513, PR #540) — offline batch process that reviews audit log, proposes YAML amendments (new `query_patterns`, join discoveries, glossary refinements). Human reviews the diff, commits what's useful. Zero runtime overhead, no DB dependency

---

## 0.8.0 — Intelligence & Learning

**SaaS differentiator: the "gets smarter over time" story.** Dynamic learning is Atlas's answer to Vanna's RAG — auditable YAML diffs vs opaque embeddings. PII detection and compliance features live in `/ee` (0.9.0).

### Learning (Phase 2 — Dynamic Layer)

---

## 0.9.0 — SaaS Infrastructure

**The milestone that makes Atlas a hosted product.** Everything before this is "software that works well." This milestone is "software you can sell."

### Tenant Provisioning

- [x] Self-serve signup flow (#644, PR #674) — email/OAuth signup → workspace creation → connect database wizard. No CLI, no `atlas init`, no YAML editing. The web equivalent of `bun create atlas-agent` but for non-developers
- [x] Workspace lifecycle (#645, PR #673) — create, suspend, delete. Cascading cleanup of connections, conversations, semantic layers, cached results
- [x] Guided semantic layer setup wizard (#649, PR #681) — web UI replacement for `atlas init`. Profile database, review generated entities, edit descriptions, preview agent behavior. Shared profiler library extracted from CLI

### Usage Metering & Billing

## 0.9.2 — Docs Persona Audit

**Systematic audit of all docs pages for persona clarity.** Every page should have a clear audience (end user, workspace admin, or platform operator) with appropriate framing, callouts, and sidebar placement.

### Phase 1 — Audit & Classification

- [x] Classify all 354 docs pages by persona (#847, PR #885) — audit table in `docs/research/persona-audit.md`, sub-issues filed for rewriting work

### Phase 2 — Structural Reorganization & Content Rewriting

- [x] Reframe deployment/config pages for SaaS vs self-hosted audiences (#878)
- [x] Reframe enterprise feature guides from customer perspective (#880)
- [x] Add persona sections to security reference pages (#881)
- [x] Relocate misplaced operator/developer guides to correct sections (#882)
- [x] Add persona sections to mixed-audience pages (#883)
- [x] Improve plugin interaction pages — chat SDK split, email digest sections (#884)

**Incremental adoption of Effect.ts** across `packages/api/`. Typed errors, dependency injection via Layers, scoped resource lifecycle, structured concurrency. Backend only — frontend stays React/Zod.

### Foundation
- [x] P0: Effect.ts foundation — install, tagged errors, Hono bridge (#903)

### Infrastructure Primitives (P1–P4)
- [x] P1: SQL validation & query execution → Effect.gen with tagged errors (#904)
- [x] P2: Rate limiting → Effect Semaphore and Ref (#905)
- [x] P3: Scheduler and delivery → Effect Schedule, Semaphore, retry (#906, PR #919)
- [x] P4: ConnectionRegistry → Effect Layer/Service with scoped resources (#907, PR #921)

### Service Architecture (P5–P8)
- [ ] P5: Plugin lifecycle → Effect Layer composition (#908)
- [ ] P6: Server startup → Effect Layer DAG (#909)
- [ ] P7: Route handlers → Effect boundaries with typed error mapping (#910)
- [ ] P8: Auth and request context → Effect Context replacing AsyncLocalStorage (#911)

### AI & Database (P10–P11)
- [ ] P10: Agent loop → @effect/ai with AiToolkit and provider Layers (#913)
- [ ] P11: Database client → @effect/sql-pg and @effect/sql-mysql2 (#914)

### Test Infrastructure
- [ ] P9: Test infrastructure → Effect Layer-based test setup (#912)

---

## 1.0.0 — SaaS Launch

**app.useatlas.dev goes live.** The hosted product where teams sign up, connect their database, and have a production-ready AI data analyst without deploying anything.

- [ ] Public pricing page on useatlas.dev (#871)
- [ ] SLA commitments — uptime guarantee, query latency targets, support response times (#872)
- [ ] Terms of service, privacy policy, DPA for enterprise (#873)
- [ ] Launch content — blog post, Show HN, comparison pages updated (#874)
- [ ] Migration tooling — self-hosted to hosted (export/import conversations, semantic layers, settings) (#875)
- [ ] Documentation for hosted users — separate onboarding flow from self-hosted docs (#876)
- [ ] Status page — public incident communication (#877)

## Ideas / Backlog

_Untracked ideas. Create issues when committing to work._

### Expand Reach (build when demand signals appear)
- Python SDK — `pip install useatlas`, thin HTTP wrapper around Atlas API. Build when a Python user asks for it, not before
- MongoDB datasource plugin — `@useatlas/mongodb`. Uses aggregation pipeline instead of SQL. Requires custom validation hook (0.6.0)
- GraphQL datasource plugin — needs custom validation like MongoDB
- Multi-seed selection in `create-atlas` (choose demo type: cybersec, ecommerce, devops)

### Competitive Positioning
- Benchmark participation — publish Spider/BIRD results for credibility. Better after `atlas learn` exists (0.7.0)
- "Powered by Atlas" badge on embedded widgets (opt-out) — viral distribution mechanic. Value scales with brand recognition
- OSI (Open Semantic Interchange) compatibility — align YAML format with emerging standard (dbt + Cube + Snowflake + ThoughtSpot)

### Product Extensions
- Dashboard persistence — save chart layouts, build lightweight dashboards from query results
- Voice input / natural language voice queries — wait for Web Speech API maturity
- Multi-agent collaboration — specialist agents per domain with coordinator routing
- `atlas migrate` — semantic layer versioning and migration tracking
- A/B testing for agent prompts — compare system prompt variants on identical queries

### MCP Enhancements
- WebSocket transport — enables real-time bidirectional communication
- Prompt templates — expose curated patterns via MCP `prompts/list`
- Resource subscriptions — notify connected clients when semantic layer changes

### Plugin Ecosystem
- Agent error recovery hooks — plugin hook for custom fallback behavior when tools fail
- Streaming action approval — SDK method for real-time action approval workflows
