// Real-Postgres migration smoke. Skips cleanly when TEST_DATABASE_URL
// is unset so local dev that hasn't run `bun run db:up` is unaffected.
//
// CI provides Postgres via a service container in the api-tests job
// and exports `TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://atlas:atlas@localhost:5432/atlas`.
// Each test runs against a unique per-test schema so concurrent shards
// don't collide; migrations are scoped to that schema via search_path.
//
// What this catches that mock-based tests can't:
//   - SQL semantic errors at plan time (the 0054 outage was
//     `subquery uses ungrouped column "outer_pc.org_id" from outer query`,
//     a deterministic plan-time error mock pools never see).
//   - Migration ordering bugs where one migration depends on a previous
//     migration's effects.
//   - CHECK / UNIQUE / FK constraint violations on the bootstrap data.
