# Atlas Roadmap

> Public repo: [AtlasDevHQ/atlas](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas). Tracking lives in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/issues) and [Milestones](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/milestones).
>
> Previous internal milestones (v0.1–v1.3) archived in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.
>
> **Versioning**: Public semver starts at 0.0.x. Internal milestones (v0.1–v1.3) were pre-public. The numbers below are public semver. 1.0.0 is the hosted SaaS launch at app.useatlas.dev.
>
> **License**: AGPL-3.0. The hosted SaaS is the primary commercial offering. Commercial embedding requires a separate license.

## North Star: 1.0.0 — SaaS Launch

Atlas 1.0.0 = hosted SaaS at **app.useatlas.dev**. Target: later 2026. Every milestone below is a stepping stone toward a production multi-tenant SaaS that teams sign up for, connect their database, and start querying — no deploy step.

The AGPL license makes the SaaS the natural path for commercial users. Self-hosted remains free and fully functional. The hosted product adds managed infrastructure, onboarding, monitoring, and support.

## Active

- **1.4.4 — Multi-environment semantic layer** ([milestone #45](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/milestones/45), original 11/11 shipped — **closeout audit reopened**) — PRD #2336; closeout 14/17 shipped, 3 findings open (#2414, #2420, #2424) + 1 follow-up (#2429). Tracker: #2407.

## Planned

Two queued milestones — next-up decision lives in `/next`.

- **1.4.5 — Chat as dashboard editor** ([milestone #46](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/milestones/46), 8 issues) — PRD #2362 + tracer-bullet drawer (#2363), per-user drafts + Publish flow (#2364), stage tracker + ghost overlays (#2365), `screenshotDashboard` vision tool (#2366 spike → #2367), archived chat sessions (#2368), `createDashboard` reframe of the #2265 spike (#2369).
- **1.5.0 — Proactive Chat** ([milestone #43](https://github.com/AtlasDevHQ/atlas/milestones/43), 11 issues) — `/ee`-gated paid tier, Slack-first. PRD #2291 + reaction-first tracer (#2292), reaction-to-answer flow (#2293), admin opt-in (#2294), three-layer kill switch (#2295), meter + audit instrumentation (#2296), public-dataset surface for non-linked askers (#2297, HITL), feedback (#2298), sensitivity presets (#2299), one-time activation (#2300), monthly quota cap (#2301).

## Closed parallel tracks

- [x] **Multi-method MFA hardening** (6 issues #2082/#2090/#2091/#2092/#2093/#2094) — WebAuthn passkeys + TOTP + trusted-device 30d shipped end-to-end across enrollment, sign-in, governance, telemetry, and recovery. Full detail in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.
- [x] **Post-1.4.2 security + polish hygiene** (PRs #2353–#2358) — npm supply-chain worm hardening (#2353), CodeQL ReDoS/sanitization/URL/shell sweep (#2355 + #2357 + #2358), rail collapse-trigger + hover scoping (#2354), dashboards-rail remount flash (#2356).
- [x] **SaaS sandbox = Vercel Sandbox exclusive** (#2382, #2383, #2387, #2389) — `deploy/api/atlas.config.ts` pins `["vercel-sandbox"]`; sidecar fallback removed so a Vercel outage hard-fails the explore tool rather than degrading isolation. Hardening tail (#2389) brands the Vercel token as `OpaqueSecret`, surfaces a SaaS hard-fail error when sandbox.priority backends all fail, and adds detector + credential-handoff tests — closes #2384/#2385/#2386.
- [x] **Post-1.4.3 bug pass** (PRs #2388, #2390) — semantic-layer whitelist now accepts dialect-quoted reserved-keyword tables (`"user"`, `` `events` ``, `[Order]`); SaaS abuse-detector escalation ladder gated by per-step dwell time (`ATLAS_ABUSE_ESCALATION_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`, default 60s) and short-circuited entirely on self-hosted (operator IS the user).

## Ideas / Backlog

_Untracked ideas. Create issues when committing to work._

### Expand Reach (build when demand signals appear)
- ~~Python SDK~~ — **closed** (#1181). No demand signal. Reopen when a Python user asks
- ~~MongoDB + GraphQL datasource plugins~~ — **closed** (#1182). Non-SQL needs major architecture work. No demand signal
- ~~Multi-seed selection in `create-atlas`~~ — **shipped** (#1188), then **reverted** in 1.4.0 (#2021). Atlas now ships a single canonical demo seed (NovaMart e-commerce); the `--seed` flag was removed and `--demo cybersec` / `--demo simple` error with a migration message. The cybersec and simple seed files are gone — git history preserves them if demand resurfaces

### Competitive Positioning
- ~~Benchmark participation~~ — **closed** (#1183). Lower priority post-launch. Revisit if needed for credibility
- ~~"Powered by Atlas" badge on embedded widgets~~ — **shipped** (PR #1265). Opt-out badge on @useatlas/react and script tag widget
- ~~OSI (Open Semantic Interchange) compatibility~~ — **closed** (#1184). Standard isn't stable yet. Adopt when it solidifies

### Product Extensions
- ~~Dashboard persistence~~ — **shipped** (#1246, PRs #1253–#1258). DB schema + CRUD API, add-to-dashboard from chat, list/view pages with DnD reorder, sharing + public view, auto-refresh via scheduler, AI-driven card suggestions
- Voice input / natural language voice queries — wait for Web Speech API maturity
- Multi-agent collaboration — specialist agents per domain with coordinator routing (#1178, deferred)
- ~~`atlas migrate`~~ — **shipped** (#1185, PR #1303). Snapshot, diff, log, rollback, auto-snapshot on `atlas improve` and `atlas init`
- ~~A/B testing for agent prompts~~ — **closed** (#1186). Needs replay infra, eval metrics, comparison UI. No demand signal

### MCP Enhancements
- WebSocket transport — enables real-time bidirectional communication
- ~~Prompt templates~~ — **shipped** (PR #1296). 5 built-in patterns + semantic layer query_patterns + prompt library
- Resource subscriptions — notify connected clients when semantic layer changes

### Plugin Ecosystem
- ~~Agent error recovery hooks~~ — **closed** (#1187). Speculative. Build when plugin authors request specific hooks
- ~~Streaming action approval~~ — **closed** (#1187). Same — build on demand
