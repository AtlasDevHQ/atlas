/**
 * Lightweight OTel metrics helpers.
 *
 * Mirrors the tracing.ts pattern: when the OTel SDK is not initialized
 * (no OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT), @opentelemetry/api returns a no-op
 * meter — zero overhead, no conditional imports needed.
 *
 * Metrics surface counters/histograms that aren't naturally captured by
 * the trace waterfall — e.g. abuse escalations are scheduled state changes
 * with no enclosing HTTP request, so they need a Meter to feed dashboards
 * and alerting hooks.
 *
 * SDK initialization lives in telemetry.ts. Adding a metric here without
 * also wiring a `metricReader` into the NodeSDK means the value is
 * collected but not exported — operators who want abuse counters in their
 * Grafana board need to extend telemetry.ts with an OTLP metrics exporter.
